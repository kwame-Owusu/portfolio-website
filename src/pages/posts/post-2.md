Nikon D3300 is my main camera that I use when I take photos, I just really started getting into photography and I found that this camera was lying around because my dad has not been using it over the years, I have come to love this camera; so far I have learned a lot about ISO,Aperture, shutter speed and more.<br>
As much as I adore this camera I intend to upgrade to a [FUJIFILM X100VI](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x100vi/) in the future, because I believe it will open my eyes to many more filmaking techniques and have better photography in general.<br>
the current lense I use on my D3300 is a [Nikon AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED](https://shorturl.at/cgATW)
