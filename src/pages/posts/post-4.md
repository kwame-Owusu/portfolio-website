The [LyxPro HAS-10](https://www.lyxpro.com/products/studio-quality-headphones-with-detachable-cables) is main headset I use at my desk.
for its price I think its quite a decent grab, especially when working with a tight budget.

The audio experience is good, because I do not hear any muffled sound or over the top tuning in the frequency.
