As someone who enjoys both coding and palying video games, having a reliable mouse is essential.
At my desk, I rely on the [Lamzu Maya](https://lamzu.com/products/lamzu-maya-4k) as my daily driver.
it's one of the finest mice I've ever used.With its featherweight design of just 45g, it offers exceptional precision, making it a breeze to aim in FPS games.

Additionally it provides a comfortable browsing experience, and comes in handy when i need to copy and paste lines of code during programming sessions.
