As someone who enjoys both coding and playing video games, having a reliable mouse is essential.
I have previously touted the Lamzu Maya and many of people who read my previous post on it thanked me for introducing them to it.

But at the moment for "pure" FPS gaming I use the OP1 8k which has been a revelation, the firmware allows me to take full
advantage of 8k polling rate and I can feel the difference in my aiming accuracy. 
At my desk, I rely on the [OP1 8K](https://www.endgamegear.com/en-gb/gaming-mice/op1-8k) as my daily driver.
I highly recommend this mouse for any FPS enthusiasts like myself(don't let the wire deceive you, it's a truly special mouse, just get a mouse bungee).
