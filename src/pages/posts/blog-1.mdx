My recent interest in [Astro](https://astro.build/) started when I was looking into what I want to eventually do after University,
and the path that I have chosen is that of going for Full-Stack Development. And as someone who is lazy as I am, I do not want to write plain HTML, CSS and Javascript although
I still think strong foundations in these languages is required.

Astro caught my eye because of [primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqp5VSqbQOY) (a SWE content creator) and  as an avid follower of him, I believed the hype train, and started
messing around with the default scaffolding when you create a new project, then from there I started reading the extensive documentation. 

The main  feature that makes Astro stand out from other static site generators and frameworks is the "Island" feature, which enables the user to have sections in their 
website or webapp that are dynamic and others that are static, this makes rendering content fast and efficient, because we have the ability to load the static parts of our site
without the need to wait for the dynamic portions of our site. 

For example:
```astro

---
import MyReactComponent from "../components/MyReactComponent"
---
<div> <MyReactComponent /> </div>
```
Whatever we have programmed for the react component to do will not come to fruition, unless we add client:load

```astro
---
import MyReactComponent from "../components/MyReactComponent"
---
<div> <MyReactComponent client:load /> </div>
```
when I was first trying Astro out this blew my mind, because now this framework  opens the door for so many more innovative ideas on how to build website and webapps
because with islands, client-side JavaScript is only loaded for the explicit interactive components that you mark using client:* directives.

One more thing that made me fell in love with Astro is how easy it is for even beginners to learn how to create website with components, I went into Astro not knowing a lot
about component-based front-end design, but now I would say I am getting better by the day, for showcasing purposes this is how my component for the blog section was created:

```astro
---
interface Props {
	title: string;
  description: string;
	date: string;
	href: string;
}

const { href, title, date,} = Astro.props;

---


<div class="outer">
  <a href={href} class="container">
    <div class="post-content">
      <div class="title"><h1>{title}</h1></div>
      <div class="date">{date}</div>
    </div>
  </a>
</div>
```
this way of looking at website as a bunch of components that can interact with each other seamlessly is quite 
fascinating to me and I wish for more people to start learning this framework after getting accustomed to HTML and CSS.

Another important feature of Astro is the flexibility it gives when deploying from sites like [vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/),
because you can specify in your astro.config.mjs how you want the output of your website or webapp to be

```astro
---
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import react from '@astrojs/react';
import mdx from "@astrojs/mdx";
import vercel from "@astrojs/vercel/serverless";
---
// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [react(), mdx()],
  output: "server",
  adapter: vercel(),
});
```
in my case I am hosting from vercel so this is the configuration needed for that, you can choose outputs from "static" for pure static website with no dynamic content,
"hybrid" for middle of the way between dynamic and static, and in my case using "sever" to deploy using vercel.


You don't need a deep understanding of JavaScript or any other framework to begin learning Astro. Its beginner-friendly nature makes it accessible to newcomers, 
The documentation is packed with valuable information, so I highly recommend giving it a thorough read. Take the leap and explore [Astro](https://astro.build/)
for yourselfâ€”it's a fantastic tool for web development. Happy coding! ðŸš€
