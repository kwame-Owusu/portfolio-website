After two years together with this PC, I am really satisfied with the performance and how quiet it is even under heavy load, the Noctua fans are a true life saver, and I would reccomend them over any other fan brand when it comes to PC builds.

The CPU and GPU are a perfect fit for each other because there is no bottleneck whatsoever when gaming, so I am able to always maximize my frames when palying. Overall, all components work together well, and are working as expected.
