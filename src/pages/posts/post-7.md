The [Keychron V1](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-v1-qmk-via-custom-mechanical-keyboard) is the main keyboard I use now, until recently I was using the [GMMK MK870](https://www.amazon.co.uk/FL-ESPORTS-MK870-Mechanical-Customizable/dp/B09GB6BRGD?th=1) with silver speed switches and a custom keycap set.<br>
The typing experience on the keychron is superior, because of the quality of the materials used to build the case; there is also the luxury of having pre-lubed stabilizers and switches out of the box, which is also a nice touch.


I have modded it with the [EPOMAKER Zebra](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CWLGRZVJ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) linear switches and the [mintcaps Rome](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BN1HT7GC?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1) keycaps these two modification have enhanced the typing quality to a major level.
