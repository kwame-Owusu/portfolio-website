The [Keychron V1](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-v1-qmk-via-custom-mechanical-keyboard) is the main keyboard I use now, until recently I was using the [GMMK MK870](https://www.amazon.co.uk/FL-ESPORTS-MK870-Mechanical-Customizable/dp/B09GB6BRGD?th=1) with silver speed switches and a custom keycap set.<br>
the typing experience on the keychron is superior, because of the quality of the materials used to build the case; there is also the luxury of having pre-lubed stabilizers and swtiches out of the box, which is also a nice touch.
