When Talking online or Debating people ðŸ«¡, I use the [Yotto Microphone](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07WFW673W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) , it is a USB microphone so it is plug and play. But I use [Voicemeeter](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/) software to make it sound quite good by tweaking the bass and other eq values.
